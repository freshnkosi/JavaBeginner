CHAPTER 1: What Is Java, and Why Is It So Great?

~ Java is a programming language in the tradition of C and C++. As a result, if you
have any experience with C or C++, you’ll often find yourself in familiar territory
as you discover the various features of Java.


Java differs from other programming languages in a couple of significant ways,
however. In this section we point out the most important differences:

# PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE: meaning that Java programs can run on many types of computers.

>>> A Java program runs on any computer with a Java Runtime Environment, also known as a
JRE, installed.

>>>Java’s platform independence isn’t based on providing compatible compilers for
different platforms. Instead, Java is based on the concept of a virtual machine. You
can think of the Java Virtual Machine (sometimes called the JVM) as being a hypothetical
computer platform — a design for a computer that doesn’t exist as actual
hardware.

>>>Instead, the JRE is an emulator — a program that sets aside part of
your hard drive to act like a computer (namely, the JVM) that can execute Java
programs.

>>>The Java compiler doesn’t translate Java into the machine language of the computer
that the program is running on. Instead, the compiler translates Java into
the machine language of the JVM, which is called bytecode.

# OBJECT ORIENTATION:

>>>which means that Java programs are made up
from programming elements called objects.

>>>an object is a programming entity that represents
either some real-world object or an abstract concept.

>>>Objects have data, also known as state. An object that represents a book, for
example, has data such as the book’s title, author, and publisher.

>>>Object perform certain tasks called methods, e.g An object that represents a car might
have methods such as start, stop, drive, and crash.

>>>Classes are closely related to objects. A class is the program code you write to create
objects.

>>>The class describes the data and methods that define the object’s state
and behavior. When the program executes, classes are used to create objects.

# THE Java API :

>>>Java comes with a library of classes
that provide commonly used utility functions that most Java programs can’t do
without. This class library, called the Java API (short for application programming
interface), is as much a part of Java as the language itself.

>>>The Java API has classes that let you do trigonometry, write data to files, create
windows onscreen, and retrieve information from a database, among other
things.

# THE INTERNET :

>>>The whole concept behind the JVM is to enable any
computer connected to the Internet to run Java programs, regardless of the type
of computer or the operating system it runs.

IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE JAVA LANGUAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# TYPE CHECKING 

>>>In Java, every class you define creates a new type of data for the language to work
with. Thus, the data types you have available to you in Java aren’t just simple
predefined types, such as numbers and strings. You can create your own types.

# AUTOMATIC MEMORY MANAGEMENT

>>>In Java, you don’t have to explicitly release memory when you’re done with it;
instead, memory is freed automatically when it’s no longer needed. The JVM
includes a special process called the garbage collector that snoops around the virtual
machine’s memory; determines when data is no longer being used; and automatically
deletes that data, freeing the memory that it occupied.

# EXCEPTION HANDLING

>>>Java has a unique approach to error handling that’s superior to that of any other
language.

>>>In Java, the JRE intercepts and folds errors of all types into a special type
of object called an exception object.
